title: AppVeyor 2.0 goes Live with the new pricing
---

I’m thrilled to announce that AppVeyor 2.0 officially goes Live and with the new aggressive pricing!

<h2>The New AppVeyor</h2>

After being almost two months in private and then public beta we finally upgraded production environment to AppVeyor 2.0 and developers truly love it!

Let me quickly recap <a href="/blog/2014/02/19/appveyor-20-dedicated-build-vms-parallel-testing-nuget-deployment">what new features AppVeyor 2.0 brings</a> to you:

<ul>
    <li>Builds run on dedicated virtual machines</li>
    <li>Project configuration in YAML (aka appveyor.yml)</li>
    <li>Fine-grained control over build process</li>
    <li>NuGet feeds hosting</li>
    <li>Build matrix and parallel testing</li>
    <li>Built-in deployment to multiple environments</li>
    <li>Responsive, real-time UI</li>
    <li>A lot of other improvements and fixes</li>
</ul>

<h2>The New Pricing</h2>

AppVeyor 2.0 moved from shared build farm to dedicated build machines. With that change it was obvious the current pricing scheme must be adjusted to justify new architecture. We received a signal from our customers that new plans felt pricey and not affordable for individual developers and small teams. This was not exactly our intention. We don’t want you to go through nightmare of installing TeamCity or Jenkins on Azure VM! :)

We want AppVeyor to be a great tool in the hands of every Windows developer! We listened to you and we revisited our plans before going Live to make sure AppVeyor pricing works for everyone.

New plans:
